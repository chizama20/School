        <p>4R is a video production team focused on capturing the creativity of Detroit’s underground scene. Made up of videographers, artists, and models the goal is to capture the creative mindsets of the Detroiters that get overlooked. The name 4R stands for "Forever exchange," meaning we will forever exchange our ideas to one another to help grow our central idea to show to the world. The goal of this collective is to showcase local talent and help the artist paint their vision of how a song can be portrayed visually. Detroit's underground art and music has evolved within the last couple of years making a noticeable impact within what's being played on the radio, but the radio doesn’t show all aspects of our art so we  are giving the opportunity to showcase your skills. They film in unique, authentic places like old warehouses, underground music venues, and hidden studios showing the real grit and passion behind the art. Their mission is to tell the stories of Detroit’s underground, giving a voice to the creative minds who are shaping the city’s future in ways that are often overlooked.</p>
