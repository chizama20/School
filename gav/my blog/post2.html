        <p>Gavin Campbell is a Detroit local that fell in love with editing at a very young age. Started off making home videos of himself wielding a lightsaber, Gavin found a love for editing and being able to control the narrative when it comes to showcasing a thought. Learning programs like adobe, editing became super easy to him and all he can do now is to continue to learn. At first, his focus was on making videos that highlighted the unique artists and musicians in Detroit, giving them the spotlight they deserved. But as he worked more closely with the community, his vision for 4R started to grow. Dreaming bigger, Gavin was seeing 4R as more than just a video team, but a platform for all kinds of creative expression. He wanted to go beyond filming and create opportunities for local artists to showcase their work through events, collaborations, and other creative projects. Whether it’s hosting art pop-ups, organizing music events, or teaming up with designers, he sees 4R as a place where different art forms can come together.At the heart of it, his goal is to build a space where Detroit’s artists can thrive and connect with a larger audience. Leaving a footprint in the mud when all said is done.</p>
